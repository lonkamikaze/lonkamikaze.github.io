TL;DR
-----

I'm a Karlsruhe based hacker, working in research and development at the
Karlsruhe University of Applied Sciences. I'm a unicyclist, FreeBSD hacker,
metal head with a fondness for 8-bit ÂµCs.

Long Version
------------

If you want to meet me, it's a good idea to contact me and meet at
a chaos event. I usually attend the [GPN](https://gulas.ch) in Karlsruhe
and the [Chaos Communication Congress](https://events.ccc.de/congress/).

I'm willing to travel to other hacker conferences, too.

If you just want to stalk me online it is best to follow me on mastodon
([@kamikaze@chaos.social](https://chaos.social/@kamikaze)) or twitter
([@lonkamikaze](https://twitter.com/lonkamikaze),
[@lonkamikaze_en](https://twitter.com/lonkamikaze_en)). You can also
follow me on [GitHub]({{ site.profile }}).

### FreeBSD

Since 2005 I am using FreeBSD and am an active member of the
[German BSD community](https://www.bsdforen.de). I'm also an active
[FreeBSD Ports maintainer](http://www.freshports.org/search.php?stype=maintainer&query=kami%40freebsd.org)
and committer and have spoken at [EuroBSDcon](https://eurobsdcon.org/).
I slipped into all these things just by trying to fix issues I stumbled over.

My latest project resulting from this is
[powerd++]({{ site.profile }}/powerdxx), my very own CPU clock daemon.
Born from my frustration with laptop fan noise it's gotten a tad
overengineered.

### Race Cars

In 2010 I joined [High Speed Karlsruhe](http://www.highspeed-karlsruhe.de),
an [FSAE](http://fsae.com/) racing team. I was the head of electronics
development for all race cars built for the seasons 2011 and 2012.
I.e. the [F-105](http://www.highspeed-karlsruhe.de/index.php/fahrzeuge/f-105),
[E-105](http://www.highspeed-karlsruhe.de/index.php/fahrzeuge/e-105)
and [F-106](http://www.highspeed-karlsruhe.de/index.php/fahrzeuge/f-106).
In my time we established the electronics platform the team is still
building upon today.

After my involvement ended I published the reusable portions of code,
the [hsk-libs]({{ site.profile }}/hsk-libs) framework for the Infineon
XC878 microcontroller.

### Type Systems

In 2015, I developed a type system as part of a simulation project.
The system validates and converts physical units at compile time.
The system is implemented as a metaprogramming library for C++11.

Because I developed a whitepaper and a workshop around the system I
put it on GitHub, the repository is simply called
[units]({{ site.profile }}/units).

I've got some nice ideas, for a more versatile system. The practical
parts of which I would like to base on C++17. But the real challenge
is the theoretical body, there is enough work to do here for a PHD
thesis. So if you want to see this happen enough to sponsor it and
have a supervisor for a (PHD or Dr. rer. nat.) handy, contact me!

### Unicycles

I'm riding unicycles since 1997. I have a collection of unicycles
for different purposes. The one I ride most is a 36" unicycle, which
I use almost daily.

I love other physical activities like climbing, swimming, martial arts
or dancing. These activities had to step behind my professional life,
but I stuck with the unicycle, because I can always do it, no matter
when, no matter where.
