This post was triggered by a question in the [LinkedIn FSAE group][LFSAE].
After writing 5 posts in response (due to the comment length limitaitons)
I finally concluded that this topic is worth some blog space. This
has been written for [Formula Student Automotive Engineering][FSAE]
teams, but a lot of it is applicable to anyone trying to secure sponsoring
for something.

In my time with [High Speed Karlsruhe][HSK] from 2010 to 2012 I secured
several sponsoring agreements, most of which are still active today
(by mutual agreement to extend).

Infrastructure
--------------

You need to have some processes in place before you start contacting
potential sponsors.

### What to Offer to Sponsors

The first thing you need to decide is what you can offer your sponsors,
here is our list:

- Link/banner from the homepage
- Company logo on the sponsoring wall
- Company logo on the vehicle
- Appearance at company parties (exhibit a former season car)

The sponsoring wall is a large stand-up display with logos from all
sponsors. One of our old cars is rigged up as a racing sim controller
so you put a computer and large monitor in front of it and people
can play a racing sim from inside a real race care - a crowd favourite.

The racing simulator makes it easy to attract attention at public
appearances and is one of the main reasons sponsors want the team
to exhibit at their parties or on their trade fair booths. Our exhibit
usually consists of last season's car, the sponsoring wall and the
simulator.

### How to Keep Your Sponsors

Acquiring sponsors is a lot of work and it is essential for the future
of your team not to piss any of them off. Work on that starts even
before you approach any potential sponsors:

- Coordinate, make a list of potential sponsors and have only one
  person contact each
- Keep some kind of database, HSK has a Wiki page for each sponsor
  (and contacted non-sponsor), marked with a *sponsoring* tag. Keep
  the following information:
  - Team member to contact the (potential) sponsor
  - Sponsor contact
  - Sponsor technical contact (optional)
  - Record of agreements (just copy/paste your e-mails)
  - Their logo as a vector image (raster images are fine for the
    homepage)
- When handing a contact over to a different team member, call your
  contact and introduce your successor
- When sponsoring is secured all contacts to the sponsor go through
  the responsible team member
- Build beautiful cars, have one person in your team dedicated to
  making pictures and post them on the homepage, facebook etc.
- Write a report to software/hardware sponsors about your experience
  with their products at the end of the season
- Send Christmas presents like a couple of calendars with your cars 
  on them to important sponsors
- Give sponsors who offer services like machining time or welding
  to you the opportunity to pitch into your team wear orders

E.g. for the 2011 season we built a combustion and an electrical car.
We overextended financially with the electrical car (batteries are
really expensive), so that was the only season we built one. But
building an electrical car got us sponsoring from Infineon.

Even though Infineon only sponsors teams building electrical cars
they made an exception for us, because we put a real effort into
our relationship with them, i.e. writing a report about our experiences,
mentioning errors in the documentation and testing results, such as
the XC878 5V µC still works after half an hour at 14V.

To this day the team uses Infineon µCs and Power MOSFETs.

#### When to Loose a Sponsor

Some sponsors are really great to work with, others are somewhat of
a hazzle. Our PCB sponsor, dating back to 2009 (AFAIK) was one of
the latter.

For 2012 we wanted to build a lot more electronics than in previous
seasons. So as soon as we had agreed on what we wanted to build I
contacted the sponsor and haggled with them. We got to an agreement
and a schedule for when we would supply them with the layouts and
get the PCBs.

When the time came I sent them the layouts and to my surprise they
wanted to talk about it and come to an agreement first. After a
week of slow communication it turned out that they had *restructured*
and nobody there knew anything about our agreements. Once it turned
out that it was a mistake on their part, they agreed to honour the
previous agreement, but by then we'd lost so much time that we simply
couldn't keep our schedule any more.

So I picked up the phone and called a PCB manufacturer which prided
itself on speed. Half an hour later we had a new sponsor who agreed
to print more PCBs than our original sponsor in less time.

Ever since they have printed PCBs on relatively short notice for us
often two or three revisions per season. This is the kind of sponsor
you want to keep. A sponsor like this is worth your investment in
time to keep them happy. The previous kind only as long as you don't
have an alternative.

In general you don't want to switch sponsors. You want to build and
maintain long lasting relationships. But sometimes it is better for
both parties to part ways.

Getting Ready
-------------

Being prepared is the greater part of securing a sponsor.

### Who to Ask for Sponsoring

Basically you can ask anyone, not just providers of goods and services
you require, but also local banks or a convenience store. Maybe the
DIY store in town is willing to sponsor you a couple of boxes and
duct tape - that's great, race cars are made out of duct tape.

Asking for software is the easiest, many software vendors sponsor
any student project, all they want is a picture of what you build,
and their logo on your homepage. There is really no reason to pirate
software.

Large companies often require you to go through an application process,
which is basically a competition against other teams to get their
sponsoring. Give it a try, but don't rely on that. Sometimes you
score underdog points for mentioning that your team is small or underfunded,
but you found some creative/unusual solutions in the past.

Trying a lot of novel things hurts the reliability of your car and
thus your performance on the race track. But if you have trouble
performing because your team just doesn't have the means to perform
proper testing you at least score experience points for trying new
things. So unless you are one of the top teams, play the cool underdog
angle.

### What to Ask for

- Software
- Hardware (catalogue parts)
- Materials
- Services (welding, machining, PCBs)
- Money

Money is the most flexible, but also the most difficult to acquire.
Software is the easiest to acquire, raw materials usually need to
be bought.

### Right Before Contact

Spend 30 to 45 minutes with the homepage of a potential sponsor,
look for the following information:

- Where are the branches of the company located, what is the scale
  of the company (# of employees)
- What kind of products do they make (not just the ones you might
  be interested in)
- How old is the company
- Is it already sponsoring another team (that can be good or bad
  for you)
- What is their mission statement
- Phone numbers

Basically you want to know who you're dealing with.

### Requirements for Personal Encounters

There are the three ways of acquiring sponsoring I know. Via phone
call, e-mail or by personal encounter.

All but one sponsoring I secured was acquired via phone, one by e-mail.
But I have seen the personal encounter work out several times. If you
want to go that way you should target trade fairs in your vicinity.

Prepare:

- Business cards
- A list of interesting exhibitors at the fair

It's convenient to seek sponsors on fairs you yourself are exhibiting
on.

The goal of a personal encounter is to create rapport. Explain FSAE,
invite the contact to look at the car, exchange business cards. Don't
hide that your goal is to secure sponsoring, but don't start haggling
unless invited to, instead contact your future sponsor via phone,
about a week after the trade fair.

### Explaining What You Do

Before getting started practice explaining what your team actually does
with a team mate, you want to get the core points across as quickly
as possible:

- Design, construction AND racing (and statics)
- Student groups, without supervision, participating is a huge achievement
- It's a global competition against competitors of which some get
  a lot more support from their universities
- It's the only racing series besides Formula one with a real focus
  on cutting edge technology development
- Try to carry on the enthusiasm, it helps if you've already been
  through a season and have seen it all

The Conversation
----------------

Once you hit the phone try to get through to the marketing department.
Usually you are screened in some way, so you may have to explain
several times:

- You are seeking sponsoring for a student project
- What FSAE is

In small companies you might end up talking to the owner, that's fine.

### Be Bold

After introductions are over and you hopefully managed to convey
some of the excitement and challenges of an FSAE event. Tell them
what you can offer to a sponsor and what you want from them. Be bold,
tell them what you *want*, not just what you *need*.

Usually you have to haggle and paddle back a little, but that's not
always the case.

I once secured sponsoring valued about €100,000 in equipment and
software licenses (so their actual costs were much lower, but far
from insignificant). The contact on the phone asked me if I was
*out of my mind* when I told them what I want. Then he told me he
has to talk to his boss about this. The next time I talked to him
I was told we would get it all.

In return they got their logo prominently displayed on both sides
of the car for 3 years.

At this point I would like to remind you how important it is to
keep a record of agreements. Lots of sponsoring deals involve signing
a contract and you really don't want to burden your succeeding team
mates with liabilities they don't even know about.

### After a Call

If you come to an agreement or are told to wait for a return call,
write an e-mail with a summary of the conversation to the contact.

If the return call does not come on time, call again the next day.
In general call weekly until you come to an agreement or your request
is denied. You want to be persistent, but not a pest.

### If You Succeed

You require a logo package from the sponsor. Preferably you want a
coloured raster image logo for your homepage and a single colour
vector image, so you can use a cutting plotter for the logos that go
[on the car](http://www.highspeed-karlsruhe.de/images/fahrzeuge/F-106/F106_links.jpg)
and on your team wear.

Sometimes a sponsor doesn't have a professional logo package. Someone
in your team may have to pick up
[tracing]. I use [inkscape] for manual tracing. Don't use an auto
tracer, the results will not be satisfactory.

Closing Statement
-----------------

Everyone can secure sponsors, practice explaining to people what you
and your team do and even introverts will be able to talk to strangers
to make them want to give you their stuff.

Remember you are doing something amazing, something the person you
are talking to may never have had the opportunity to do. By sponsoring
you they have an opportunity to become part of that.
And that, I think, is the main reason for most sponsors. You have
to offer them incentives so they can justify the decision to their
peers and themselves, but you win a sponsor by convincing them, that
you are doing something awesome.

BTW, if you ever run out of logo space,
[build cars with wings](http://www.highspeed-karlsruhe.de/images/fahrzeuge/f-110//IMG_0568.JPG).
Plus they make your race car faster, the ultimate goal in your quest
for sponsors.
