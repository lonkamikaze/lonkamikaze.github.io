Five days ago, legendary unicyclist, Dan Heaton released Revolution One.
Revolution One is not your common unicycling video like *UNiVERSE*
or *defect*. Instead it delivers a story about Off-Road and Street
unicycling from the 80s to this day. It covers the popular riders like
Kris Holm and Dan Heaton himself as well as people who are only well-known
within the community, like John Foss.

from [Dan Heaton](http://vimeo.com/danheaton) on [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com).

Dan Heaton has been notoriously absent from the public unicycling
community for some years. All the more pleasant to see that he returns
with such a beautiful homage to this sport. A must see for every
unicyclist out there and an eye-opener to those who are not familiar
with the world of modern day unicycling.
