[EuroBSDcon 2016](https://2016.eurobsdcon.org/) is over. It was an
amazing event and I loved the engaging audience attending my talk.
I'd like to use this opportunity to thank Yamagi for providing me
with some real server loads up to `ncpu=40`.

I put the slides online, they are not too useful on their own, but
if you want to have a closer look at some of the graphs, they might
be of use:
