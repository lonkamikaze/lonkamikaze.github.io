I just decided not to move the `SIGWINCH` related articles over from
the old blog. The topic is good for a nice article about subtle
incompatibilities and unexpected execution paths in software. But
the articles that are there are just not well developed.

That also means the move is completed. Since the last post I added
a bit of stuff to the left and right bars. If the currently opened
page is divided into sections, the left bar offers a table of contents.
The right bar shows tags and social media links. In small screen mode
the tags pop up under the article heading, the other stuff is lost.
